# Project Link [Async Race](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/suficks-JSFE2023Q4/async-race/)

## **Async Race**: Manage your car park and compete on the track!

## Async Race is an exciting application that allows you to manage your own garage with cars and arrange exciting races on a virtual track. Your task is to modify, add and remove cars from the garage, adjust their driving speed and go racing to find out whose car is faster.

## Key Features:
- *Fleet Management*: You have access to a wide selection of cars in your garage. You can add new cars, remove ones you no longer need, and customize their characteristics.
- *Speed Settings*: By interacting with the server through Fetch technology, you can retrieve the speed set on the server and apply it to your machines. This allows you to create realistic racing conditions.
- *Exciting Racing*: After adjusting the speed of the cars, you can go to the track and have a race.
- *Realistic conditions*: By interacting with the server, you can be sure that the machine speed information is up to date and only intentional errors from the server will occur.
- *Simple and Clear Interface*: The intuitive interface makes using Async Race easy and fun even for beginners.
